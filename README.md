# JeffGreenNumber
 
(W.I.P)

An NBA version of the popular "Kevin Bacon Number" which measures an actor's degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. Similarly, this program intends to find a given NBA player's degrees of separation from NBA journeyman Jeff Green. So a player like Kevin Durant who's played on the same team as Jeff Green would have a Green Number of 0, while a player like Steph Curry who has never played with Jeff Green but has played with Kevin Durant would have a Green number of 1, and so forth. This algorithm uses graph theory and Depth First Search to find a player's degrees of separation.
